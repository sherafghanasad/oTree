    This brief screener is a part of a research project at the Iowa State University. You will
    receive $0.05 for completing the screener, which is used to see if you are eligible for the
    full study. Individuals who qualify will be immediately invited to participate in a 15-minute

    screening questionnaire, all the information about you will be destroyed.

    <b>Description of Procedures</b>

<p>
    To be considered for participation in the study, you will have to answer few demographic
    questions and upload a picture using your webcam. In the next screen, your browser will
    ask permission to access your webcam which you must accept. Once you have
    filled out the survey and submitted the picture, you may be invited to participate in the
    full study. In the full study, you will be randomly matched with another participant. You
    and your randomly matched participant will make decisions about bonuses for each other and
    one of you will work on a simple task that will affect your and your matched participant earnings.
    The experiment will last for either 5 minutes or 15 minutes depending on your role in the
    experiment. You will be asked to upload a picture later in the full study which may be showed to your
    matched participant. You will be given more information about the structure of the study in the
