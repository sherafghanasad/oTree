<p>
    Welcome! Please read the following instructions very carefully.
</p>

<p>
    In this study, you and another participant have been matched together to form a two-member team -
    think of yourself as the worker and your team member as your boss. You, as worker,
    will work on a button-pressing task (to be described below) for upto 10 minutes. Both you and your boss will earn
    $1 simply for participating in this study. You may each earn additional bonus amounts based on the decisions you and your
    boss take. Your respective earnings will be transferred to your accounts within 24 hours.
</p>

<p>
    Once you start working on the button-pressing task, your team will earn $0.10 for every 100
    points you score. However, before you start the task, your boss will decide and announce
    how he/she will split the $0.10 between you and him/her. Your share (out of $0.10) will be your bonus rate for working
    on the task. Of course, the bigger the bonus rate your boss chooses for you, the less his/her own bonus will be.
</p>

<p>
    Specifically, your boss must select a bonus rate of either 0, 3, 6 or 9 cents for every 100 points scored by you.
    For example, if your boss chose 3 cents per 100 points for you, he/she will keep 7 cents for himself/herself.
</p>

<p>
    The point at which your boss decided the bonus rate for you, he/she did not know anything about your identity.
    He/she will observe the points scored by you once you have finished working on the task.
</p>

<p>
    <b>
        To summarize, your boss has selected a bonus rate of either 0, 3, 6 or 9 cents for every 100 points
        scored by you on a button-pressing task. On the next screen, you will see the bonus rate selected and you will
        then work on the task for upto 10 minutes. Bonus payments will be determined once you have finished working on the task.
    </b>
</p>


<p>
    <h5>Description of the Task:</h5> The object of the task is to alternately press the “a” and “b” buttons on the
    keyboard as quickly as possible for 10 minutes. Every time you successfully press the “a” and then the “b” button,
    you will receive a point. Note that points will only be rewarded when you alternate button pushes: just pressing
    the “a” or the “b” button without alternating between the two will not result in points. Buttons must be pressed
    by hand only (key-bindings or automated button-pushing programs/scripts cannot be used) or the task will not be
    approved. Feel free to score as many points as you can.
</p>

<p>
    Below is an example of how the task will work. Try pressing "a" and "b" alternately to score points. Below we have
    limited the maximum number of points you can score to 30 as this is just practice, but the actual task will not have
    a point limit. In the actual task, you will have 10 minutes to score as many points as you can. You may stop
    anytime before the 10-minute mark is up. Of course, the longer you work on the task, the more points you will score.

</p>


<p> Press 'a' then 'b'</p>

<p><h1>Points: <span id="points">0</span></h1></p>

            if (!x) return;
            if (points<30) {
                target.textContent = ++points;
