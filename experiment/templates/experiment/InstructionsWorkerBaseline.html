<p>
    Welcome to our economics experiment! Please read the following instructions very carefully.
</p>

<p>
    Your task is to work on a simple button-pressing task for 10 minutes at bonus rate selected by another participant
    (details of button-pressing task are given below). Both you and the other participant will be paid 1 dollar just
    for participating in this study, you both can earn additional bonus amount depending on the decisions in this
    experiment. The bonuses will be paid in 24 hours.
</p>

<p>
    The other participant could select any rate between 0 cents and 10 cents for every 100 points scored by you in
    the task. In the next screen you will see the bonus rate selected by the other participant and you will then work
    on a task for 10 minutes. While you will earn a bonus of x cents for every 100 points that you score, the other
    participant will receive (10-x) cents as a bonus for every 100 points scored by you.
</p>

<p>
    The other participant does not know anything about your identity and will only see the points scored by
    you after you have finished working on the task.
</p>

<p>
    To summarize, the other participant has selected a bonus rate between 0 and 10 cents for every 100 points scored by you.
    In the next screen you will see the bonus rate selected and you will then work on a button pressing task for 10 minutes.
    Bonus payments will be determined once you have finished working on the task.
</p>

<p>
    <h6>Description of the Task:</h6> The object of the task is to alternately press the “a” and “b” buttons on the
    keyboard as quickly as possible for 10 minutes. Every time you successfully press the “a” and then the “b” button,
    you will receive a point. Note that points will only be rewarded when you alternate button pushes: just pressing
    the “a” or the “b” button without alternating between the two will not result in points. Buttons must be pressed
    by hand only (key-bindings or automated button-pushing programs/scripts cannot be used) or the task will not be
    approved. Feel free to score as many points as you can.
</p>

<p>
    Make sure you understand the instructions before proceeding. The next screen will ask you questions to test
    your understanding of the experiment.
