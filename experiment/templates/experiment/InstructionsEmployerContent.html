<p>
    Welcome! Please read the following instructions very carefully.
</p>

<p>
    In this study, you and another participant have been matched together to form a two-member team -
    think of yourself as the boss and your team member as the worker. Your team member/worker
    will work on a button-pressing task (to be described on the next page) for upto 10 minutes. Each of you will earn $1 simply
    for participating in this study. You may each earn additional bonus amounts based on the decisions you and your
    worker take. Your respective earnings will be transferred to your accounts within 24 hours.
</p>

<p>
    Once the button-pressing task begins, your team will earn $0.10 for every 100
    points your worker will score. However, before the worker starts the task, you have
    to decide how much of these $0.10 you want to split between yourself and your worker.
    The amount you select for the worker will serve as his/her bonus rate for the task.
    Specifically, out of the 10 cents per 100 points that your team will receive,
    you can choose to give 0, 3, 6 or 9 cents to your worker, keeping the rest for
    yourself. Of course, the bigger the bonus rate you choose for your worker,
    the less your own bonus will be.
    On the other hand, you would want to try and incentivize your worker to
    score as many points as possible.
</p>


<p>
    Your worker will not know anything about your identity and will only see the bonus rate selected by
    you before starting to work on the task.
</p>

<p>
    <b>
        To summarize, all you will need to do is select a bonus rate for your worker who will observe what
        you have chosen before starting work on the button-pressing task. Bonus payments will be determined once
        your worker has finished working on the task.
    </b>
</p>


<p>
    Here is one EXAMPLE of what can happen in the experiment.

<p>
    Here is an illustrative calculator for practice which you can use to
    calculate hypothetical earned bonuses. To do that, first select a bonus rate
    for the worker (0, 3, 6 or 9 cents per 100 points). Next enter the
    number of points you <b>imagine</b> the worker will score. The calculator
    will show you the earned bonus amounts for you and your worker.
    Of course, these bonuses are hypothetical since you don't know how many points
    the worker will actually score.

    This calculator will remain accessible to you at the time
    you will be making
    your decision about the bonuses.
