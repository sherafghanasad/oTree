<p>
    Here is the description of the button-pressing task that your worker will see.
    On the next screen, you will get a chance to familiarize yourself with the same task
    but only for a limited time of 30 seconds.
</p>

<p>
    <h5>Description of the Task for Worker:</h5><i> The object of the task is to alternately press the “a” and “b” buttons on the
    keyboard as quickly as possible for 10 minutes. Every time you successfully press the “a” and then the “b” button,
    you will score a point. Note that points will only be scored when you alternate button pushes: just pressing
    the “a” or the “b” button without alternating between the two will not result in points. Buttons must be pressed
    by hand only (key-bindings or automated button-pushing programs/scripts cannot be used) or the task will not be
    approved. Feel free to score as many points as you can.</i>
