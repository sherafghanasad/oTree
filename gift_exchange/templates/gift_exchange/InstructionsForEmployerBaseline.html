<p>
    This experiment is part of the research project conducted by Iowa State University. It is used to analyze decision
    behavior in markets. The instructions are simple and if you read them carefully and make appropriate decisions, you
    can earn money ranging from zero to 8 dollars (on top of 3 dollars participation fee). Your earnings will be
    calculated in points which will be converted to dollars at the end of experiment at the following rate;
</p>

<h6> 1 point = 10 cents </h6>
<p>
    In this whole experiment consider yourself as an employer who is hiring workers. These workers are real people
    (like yourself) who are assigned the “role of worker” by the experimenters. As part of this experiment you will
    be randomly matched with different workers. You will select a wage offer for the matched worker and the worker
    will select the effort level.
</p>

<p>
    Effort is costly to workers but profitable to employers (like yourself). Throughout this experiment, your randomly
    matched worker will not know your identity.
</p>

<p>
    The experiment will consist of 10 periods. In each period you will be matched with a new worker. Each period will
    consist of two stages. In the first stage you (employer) will select a wage level. In the second stage worker will
    see the wage and choose the effort level. Wage rate and effort level will affect yours and your worker’s earnings.
    Your worker’s earning from a period will be as follows;
</p>

<h6> Worker Earning = (Wage - 20 - Effort Cost)</h6>

<p>
    Your (employer) earning will be as follows;
</p>

<h6> Employer Earning = (120 - Wage) x Effort </h6>

<p>
    Putting more effort is costly to workers but it benefits you (employer). Worker’s cost for each allowed level of
    efforts is as follows;
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Effort</th>
    <th>Effort Cost</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0.1</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0.2</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0.3</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0.4</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0.5</td>
    <td>6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0.6</td>
    <td>8</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0.7</td>
    <td>10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0.8</td>
    <td>12</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0.9</td>
    <td>15</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>18</td>
  </tr>

<p>
    You (employer) can offer any wage between 20 and 120 (in increments of 5).
</p>

<p>
    For example, if you (employer) selected the wage offer of 50, your worker chose effort level of 0.5 and you
    (employer) decided to choose Multiplier = 1.5 then your worker’s and yours earning will be as follows;
</p>


<h6> Worker Earning = (50 - 20 - 6) = 24 </h6>

<h6> Employer Earning = (120 - 50) x 0.5 = 35 </h6>

<p>
    Throughout the experiment you will have access to on-screen calculator in which you can input different values for
    effort and see your earnings and your employers’ earning for that period before submitting your effort choice.
    As already mentioned there will be 10 periods in this experiment, which means you will make an effort choice 10 times
    (for 10 different employers). At the end of this experiment, one of the 10 periods will be randomly chosen by the
    computer and you and your final earnings will be what you and your worker earned in that chosen period. It is in your
    interest to do your best in each period.
</p>

<p>
    Make sure you understand the instructions before proceeding. The next screen will ask you questions related to some
     arbitrary examples of what could happen in the experiment. These instructions will be accessible to you throughout
      the experiment.
