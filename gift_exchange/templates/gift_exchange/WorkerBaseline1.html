        In this period, you are matched with the following employer. Before you can see the actual wage selected by
        the employer, you need to make a guess of the selected wage. If your guess is exactly right, you will get 5
        extra points. If it deviates by 5 points you will get 3 extra points. If it deviates by 10 points you will
        get 1 extra point. If it deviates by more than 10, you wonâ€™t get any extra points.
